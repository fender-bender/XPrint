# XPrint
A portable, fast, space effecient, and versatile 3d printer inspired by the Positron and work done by KRAYLYN 3D

This project aims to improve on the Positron V3 by simplyfying sourcing, reducing cost, increasing performance, maximizing versatility, and increasing print space to frame size effeciency.

# How we accomplish this:
We leverage the compactness, speed, and simple belt path of the T-Bot cartesian motion system to allow for easier sourcing, high print speeds, and a good print space to frame size factor.

We also aim to minimize custom machined parts, allowing for the average hobbyist to make this printer without needing access to pricey cnc machine tools. And any custom machined parts aim to be simple and easy to manfacture, allowing the use of printed jigs and basic power tools such as a router to manufacture the components.

Furthermore, we utilize a unique enclosure solution with a flexible bellow to create a lightweight and effective enclosure allowing for an increased range of functional materials such as abs/asa and nylon compared to the positrons limited range of pla, petg, tpu, and some other select materials.

Finally, we are able to maximize space use by turning the gantry 90 degrees, allowing us to increase the rail length by ~sqrt(2) meaning we can more effeciently use the bed space without having to make the printer frame any bigger.
